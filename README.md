# TCP/IP Client-Server Logging Simulator

This project demonstrates a simple client-server communication using TCP/IP, along with a basic logging mechanism based on log severity levels.

## ðŸ”€ Branch Structure

- **`main`**: Contains the **client-side** code.
- **`master`**: Contains the **server-side** code.

## ðŸªµ Log Severity Levels

### ðŸ”´ Critical

- A warning message is displayed, and the client is **forcefully shut down**.
- The server logs this as a **Critical Issue**.

### ðŸŸ  Error
